### Hello!

After 4 years at Malt, the biggest french freelancer marketplace, I decided recently to to become a freelancer and spoiler alert... being a freelancer is great!

⏳ I still like to work within a team though, which is why I tend to prefer missions of at least 3 months.

#### 💚 For the moment, my favorite stack is :

* Typescript
* Vue.js
* Jest
* SASS

🧠 I'm not limited to those tech at all and love learning new stuff. Your projet is challenging and interesting? Then your stack stack will be mine :)

#### 🎖️ My future goals are :

* Learn another javascript framework (probably React.js)
* Teach (JS or Vue.js)
* Participate in meetups

#### 🤐 A secret projet ?

Beside my missions, I'm also working on another project that gives me the opportunity to train on Flutter and mobile development, but hey... it's a secret.

#### 🌟 I'm not just a programmer

I love my job, but hey, it's a job, on my free time, here are the things I love to do :

* 🏃 Running : I'm waiting for the half marathon in Paris ! (postponed to september due to COVID-19)
* 📚 Reading : my favorite authors : Virginie Despentes and Pierre Lemaître... Gosh I LOVE their work.
* 🤣 Comedy clubs : Today was a hard day ? Just forget about work, grab a beer and go to a comedy club. A lot of good adresses in Paris. Always a good time !
